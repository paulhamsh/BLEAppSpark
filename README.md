# BLEAppSpark
Server and client on M5 Core 2 to talk to Spark app and Spark amp with NimBLE

Works perfectly - a pass-thru from app to amp using BLE on a single M5Stack Core 2

With a lot of help from h2zero (see the github issue I created and the responses! https://github.com/h2zero/NimBLE-Arduino/issues/298)
